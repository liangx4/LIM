INTRODUCING

LIM is a truly minimalist WordPress theme. I modified it from the theme Dogma and mnmlist. It keeps every aspect of the design to a minimum:

1 single page design for every page, with the archive and links to other pages ever present
1 column
1 typeface in 1 color, 1 size and 2 weights
Title as header
4 basic footer
No logo
No search functionality
Use clean my archive as separate archive page
No date mention
No author name
Minimal commenting

Just the articles.
