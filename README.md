INTRODUCING

LIM is a truly minimalist WordPress theme. I modified it from the theme Dogma and mnmlist. It keeps every aspect of the design to a minimum:

1 single page design for every page, with the archive and links to other pages ever present
1 column
1 typeface in 1 color, 1 size and 2 weights
Title as header
4 basic footer
No logo
No search functionality
Use clean my archive as separate archive page
No date mention
No author name
Minimal commenting

Just the articles.



COPYRIGHT

The LIM theme is entirely uncopyrighted Â– use as you like, spread it, sell it, do whatever you want.

Enjoy!
